# 7,4 Hamming Code Calculator in Javascript
To run, use an online JS compiler like [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/). This script takes a single four-bit `input`, transforms it into a seven-bit `codeword` (four bits of input, three bits of parity), adds noise `noisy_codeword`, and prints the decoded `output`.
